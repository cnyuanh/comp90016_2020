    "# Quality control for sequencing data\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you had a biological question of interest that could be solved by sequencing. You've received some funding to perform a sequencing run (lucky you!). The sample is run in a sequencing machine (you know a few kinds of sequencers by now) and you are delivered a file containing all of your reads. It is possible that there were problems in the sequencer or the starting material used for sequencing (DNA). Before you perform your analysis and report your findings, you want to be sure that the data you have is of good quality. This is where quality control (QC) comes in.\n",
